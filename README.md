Implementation of the FIPS 180-4

I will try to make the functions executions as fast as I can using the C language together with parallel programming and different branches for CUDA and OpenCL for GPU optimization.

Post.: I know nothing about the hash functions specifications, but I believe that they can be optimized :). I'm in the learning process of code optimization and GPU programming, so, be patient.
